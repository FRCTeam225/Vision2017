# Vision 2017

Android vision for 2017, runs onboard the robot on a Nexus 5X

Compared to our 2016 offseason phone vision project:

- Does all processing inside JNI methods
- Processed frames are available through a built in MJPEG server
- Uses Camera2 through 254's BetterCamera2 interface instead of OpenCV's JavaCameraView
